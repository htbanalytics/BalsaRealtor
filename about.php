            <p>I was born and raised in Aptos, California and graduated from Aptos High School before heading down to beautiful UC Santa Barbara to earn my Bachelor of Sciences degree in Economics. I spent my youth traveling around Europe with, my now, beaufiful wife. I joined the Holcomb Corporation in 2016 and earned my Realtor's license in 2019 (DRE# XXXXXXX) and have since earned the respect of fellow agents and colleagues.</p>
            <p>When I'm not busy find or selling your dream home you can find me on the golf links or enjoying the vast outdoors Santa Cruz County has to offer with my wife. </p>
